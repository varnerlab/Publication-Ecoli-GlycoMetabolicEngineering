	Abstract = {To examine the relationship between folding and export competence by the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway we analyzed the subcellular localization of fusions between a set of eight putative Tat leader peptides and alkaline phosphatase in isogenic Escherichia coli strains that either allow or disfavor the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We show that export by the Tat translocator is observed only in strains that enable oxidative protein folding in the cytoplasm. Further, we show that other disulfide-containing proteins, namely single-chain Fv and heterodimeric F(AB) antibody fragments, are export-competent only in strains having an oxidizing cytoplasm. Functional, heterodimeric F(AB) protein was exported from the cytoplasm by means of a Tat leader peptide fused to the heavy chain alone, indicating that the formation of a disulfide-bonded dimer preceeds export. These results demonstrate that in vivo only proteins that have attained the native conformation are exported by the Tat translocator, indicating that a folding quality-control mechanism is intrinsic to the export process. The ability to export proteins with disulfide bonds and the folding proofing feature of the Tat pathway are of interest for biotechnology applications.},

	Abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni has a general N-linked protein glycosylation system that can be functionally transferred to Escherichia coli. In this study, we engineered E. coli cells in a way that two different pathways, protein N-glycosylation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, converge at the step in which PglB, the key enzyme of the C. jejuni N-glycosylation system, transfers O polysaccharide from a lipid carrier (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate) to an acceptor protein. PglB was the only protein of the bacterial N-glycosylation machinery both necessary and sufficient for the transfer. The relaxed specificity of the PglB oligosaccharyltransferase toward the glycan structure was exploited to create novel N-glycan structures containing two distinct E. coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigens. PglB-mediated transfer of polysaccharides might be valuable for in vivo production of O polysaccharides-protein conjugates for use as antibacterial vaccines.},

	Abstract = {Two cassettes with tetracycline-resistance (TcR) and kanamycin-resistance (KmR) determinants have been developed for the construction of insertion and deletion mutants of cloned genes in Escherichia coli. In both cassettes, the resistance determinants are flanked by the short direct repeats (FRT sites) required for site-specific recombination mediated by the yeast Flp recombinase. In addition, a plasmid with temperature-sensitive replication for temporal production of the Flp enzyme in E. coli has been constructed. After a gene disruption or deletion mutation is constructed in vitro by insertion of one of the cassettes into a given gene, the mutated gene is transferred to the E. coli chromosome by homologous recombination and selection for the antibiotic resistance provided by the cassette. If desired, the resistance determinant can subsequently be removed from the chromosome in vivo by Flp action, leaving behind a short nucleotide sequence with one FRT site and with no polar effect on downstream genes. This system was applied in the construction of an E. coli endA deletion mutation which can be transduced by P1 to the genetic background of interest using TcR as a marker. The transductant can then be freed of the TcR if required.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although constraint-based flux analysis of knockout strains has facilitated the production of desirable metabolites in microbes, current screening methods have placed a limitation on the number knockouts that can be simultaneously analyzed.
RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel screening method named FastPros. In this method, the potential of a given reaction knockout for production of a specific metabolite is evaluated by shadow pricing of the constraint in the flux balance analysis, which generates a screening score to obtain candidate knockout sets. To evaluate the performance of FastPros, we screened knockout sets to produce each metabolite in the entire Escherichia coli metabolic network. We found that 75% of these metabolites could be produced under biomass maximization conditions by adding up to 25 reaction knockouts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using FastPros in tandem with another screening method, OptKnock, could further improve target metabolite productivity.

	Abstract = {To which extent can optimality principles describe the operation of metabolic networks? By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

However, there are no methods to systematically identify functional allosteric protein-metabolite interactions. Here we present an experimental and computational approach for using dynamic metabolite data to discover allosteric regulation that is relevant in vivo. By switching the culture conditions of Escherichia coli every 30 s between medium containing either pyruvate or (13)C-labeled fructose or glucose, we measured the reversal of flux through glycolysis pathways and observed rapid changes in metabolite concentration. We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, from large sets of putative allosteric interactions, our approach can identify the most likely ones and provide hypotheses about their function.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system acts like a sensory element which is able to measure the flux through glycolysis. Since the output of the sensor, the phosphorylated form of protein EIIA, is connected to the activity of the global transcription factor Crp, the kinetic and structural properties of the system are important for the understanding of the overall cellular behavior.
RESULTS: A family of mathematical models is presented, varying with respect to their degree of complexity (number of reactions that are taken into account, number of parameters) that show a structurally and quantitatively robust behavior. The models describe a set of experimental data that relates the output of the sensor to the specific growth rate. A central element that is responsible for the structural robustness is a feed-forward loop in the glycolysis, namely the activation of the pyruvate kinase reaction by a metabolite of the upper part of the glycolysis. The robustness is shown for variations of the measured data as well as for variations of the parameters.

	Abstract = {The response of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism to genetic and environmental manipulation has been studied by use of a recently developed methodology for metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis; this methodology can also directly reveal active metabolic pathways. Generation of fluxome data arrays by use of the METAFoR approach is based on two-dimensional (13)C-(1)H correlation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with fractionally labeled biomass and, in contrast to metabolic flux analysis, does not require measurements of extracellular substrate and metabolite concentrations. METAFoR analyses of E. coli strains that moderately overexpress phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, or alcohol dehydrogenase revealed that only a few flux ratios change in concert with the overexpression of these enzymes. Disruption of both pyruvate kinase isoenzymes resulted in altered flux ratios for reactions connecting the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate pools but did not significantly alter central metabolism. These data indicate remarkable robustness and rigidity in central carbon metabolism in the presence of genetic variation. More significant physiological changes and flux ratio differences were seen in response to altered environmental conditions. For example, in ammonia-limited chemostat cultures, compared to glucose-limited chemostat cultures, a reduced fraction of PEP molecules was derived through at least one transketolase reaction, and there was a higher relative contribution of anaplerotic PEP carboxylation than of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for oxaloacetate synthesis. These two parameters also showed significant variation between aerobic and anaerobic batch cultures. Finally, two reactions catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase and malic enzyme were identified by METAFoR analysis; these had previously been considered absent in E. coli cells grown in glucose-containing media. Backward flux from the TCA cycle to glycolysis, as indicated by significant activity of PEP carboxykinase, was found only in glucose-limited chemostat culture, demonstrating that control of this futile cycle activity is relaxed under severe glucose limitation.},

	Abstract = {Pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase are generally considered to be the major sources of the anabolic reductant NADPH. As one of very few microbes, Escherichia coli contains two transhydrogenase isoforms with unknown physiological function that could potentially transfer electrons directly from NADH to NADP+ and vice versa. Using defined mutants and metabolic flux analysis, we identified the proton-translocating transhydrogenase PntAB as a major source of NADPH in E. coli. During standard aerobic batch growth on glucose, 35-45% of the NADPH that is required for biosynthesis was produced via PntAB, whereas pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase contributed 35-45% and 20-25%, respectively. The energy-independent transhydrogenase UdhA, in contrast, was essential for growth under metabolic conditions with excess NADPH formation, i.e. growth on acetate or in a phosphoglucose isomerase mutant that catabolized glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, both isoforms have divergent physiological functions: energy-dependent reduction of NADP+ with NADH by PntAB and reoxidation of NADPH by UdhA. Expression appeared to be modulated by the redox state of cellular metabolism, because genetic and environmental manipulations that increased or decreased NADPH formation down-regulated pntA or udhA transcription, respectively. The two transhydrogenase isoforms provide E. coli primary metabolism with an extraordinary flexibility to cope with varying catabolic and anabolic demands, which raises two general questions: why do only a few bacteria contain both isoforms, and how do other organisms manage NADPH metabolism?},

	Abstract = {The application of metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli has resulted in the generation of strains with the capacity to produce metabolites of commercial interest. Biotechnological processes with these engineered strains frequently employ culture media containing glucose as the carbon and energy source. In E. coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) transports glucose when this sugar is present at concentrations like those used in production fermentations. This protein system is involved in phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar transport, therefore, its activity has an important impact on carbon flux distribution in the phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate nodes. Furthermore, PTS has a very important role in carbon catabolite repression. The properties of PTS impose metabolic and regulatory constraints that can hinder strain productivity. For this reason, PTS has been a target for modification with the purpose of strain improvement. In this review, PTS characteristics most relevant to strain performance and the different strategies of PTS modification for strain improvement are discussed. Functional replacement of PTS by alternative phosphoenolpyruvate-independent uptake and phosphorylation activities has resulted in significant improvements in product yield from glucose and productivity for several classes of metabolites. In addition, inactivation of PTS components has been applied successfully as a strategy to abolish carbon catabolite repression, resulting in E. coli strains that use more efficiently sugar mixtures, such as those obtained from lignocellulosic hydrolysates.},

While sugar catabolism proceeds mainly via oxidative or non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, anaplerosis and the initial steps of gluconeogenesis are accomplished by C3- (PEP- and/or pyruvate-) carboxylation and C4- (oxaloacetate- and/or malate-) decarboxylation, respectively. In contrast to the relatively uniform central metabolic pathways in bacteria, the set of enzymes at the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node represents a surprising diversity of reactions. Variable combinations are used in different bacteria and the question of the significance of all these reactions for growth and for biotechnological fermentation processes arises. This review summarizes what is known about the enzymes and the metabolic fluxes at the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node in bacteria, with a particular focus on the C3-carboxylation and C4-decarboxylation reactions in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. We discuss the activities of the enzymes, their regulation and their specific contribution to growth under a given condition or to biotechnological metabolite production. The present knowledge unequivocally reveals the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate nodes of bacteria to be a fascinating target of metabolic engineering in order to achieve optimized metabolite production.},

@article{2008-rocha-nielsen-patil-BMCBioinfo,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the greatest challenges in Metabolic Engineering is to develop quantitative models and algorithms to identify a set of genetic manipulations that will result in a microbial strain with a desirable metabolic phenotype which typically means having a high yield/productivity. This challenge is not only due to the inherent complexity of the metabolic and regulatory networks, but also to the lack of appropriate modelling and optimization tools. To this end, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proposed for in silico metabolic engineering, for example, to identify sets of gene deletions towards maximization of a desired physiological objective function. In this approach, each mutant strain is evaluated by resorting to the simulation of its phenotype using the Flux-Balance Analysis (FBA) approach, together with the premise that microorganisms have maximized their growth along natural evolution.
RESULTS: This work reports on improved EAs, as well as novel Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms to address the task of in silico metabolic engineering. Both approaches use a variable size set-based representation, thereby allowing the automatic finding of the best number of gene deletions necessary for achieving a given productivity goal. The work presents extensive computational experiments, involving four case studies that consider the production of succinic and lactic acid as the targets, by using S. cerevisiae and E. coli as model organisms. The proposed algorithms are able to reach optimal/near-optimal solutions regarding the production of the desired compounds and presenting low variability among the several runs.
CONCLUSION: The results show that the proposed SA and EA both perform well in the optimization task. A comparison between them is favourable to the SA in terms of consistency in obtaining optimal solutions and faster convergence. In both cases, the use of variable size representations allows the automatic discovery of the approximate number of gene deletions, without compromising the optimality of the solutions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Through genetic engineering it is possible to introduce targeted genetic changes and hereby engineer the metabolism of microbial cells with the objective to obtain desirable phenotypes. However, owing to the complexity of metabolic networks, both in terms of structure and regulation, it is often difficult to predict the effects of genetic modifications on the resulting phenotype. Recently genome-scale metabolic models have been compiled for several different microorganisms where structural and stoichiometric complexity is inherently accounted for. New algorithms are being developed by using genome-scale metabolic models that enable identification of gene knockout strategies for obtaining improved phenotypes. However, the problem of finding optimal gene deletion strategy is combinatorial and consequently the computational time increases exponentially with the size of the problem, and it is therefore interesting to develop new faster algorithms.
RESULTS: In this study we report an evolutionary programming based method to rapidly identify gene deletion strategies for optimization of a desired phenotypic objective function. We illustrate the proposed method for two important design parameters in industrial fermentations, one linear and other non-linear, by using a genome-scale model of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Potential metabolic engineering targets for improved production of succinic acid, glycerol and vanillin are identified and underlying flux changes for the predicted mutants are discussed.
CONCLUSION: We show that evolutionary programming enables solving large gene knockout problems in relatively short computational time. The proposed algorithm also allows the optimization of non-linear objective functions or incorporation of non-linear constraints and additionally provides a family of close to optimal solutions. The identified metabolic engineering strategies suggest that non-intuitive genetic modifications span several different pathways and may be necessary for solving challenging metabolic engineering problems.},

	Abstract = {Annotated genome sequences can be used to reconstruct whole-cell metabolic networks. These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions. In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

	Abstract = {The advent of genome-scale models of metabolism has laid the foundation for the development of computational procedures for suggesting genetic manipulations that lead to overproduction. In this work, the computational OptKnock framework is introduced for suggesting gene deletion strategies leading to the overproduction of chemicals or biochemicals in E. coli. This is accomplished by ensuring that a drain towards growth resources (i.e., carbon, redox potential, and energy) must be accompanied, due to stoichiometry, by the production of a desired product. Computational results for gene deletions for succinate, lactate, and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) production are in good agreement with mutant strains published in the literature. While some of the suggested deletion strategies are straightforward and involve eliminating competing reaction pathways, many others suggest complex and nonintuitive mechanisms of compensating for the removed functionalities. Finally, the OptKnock procedure, by coupling biomass formation with chemical production, hints at a growth selection/adaptation system for indirectly evolving overproducing mutants.},

	Abstract = {Integrated approaches utilizing in silico analyses will be necessary to successfully advance the field of metabolic engineering. Here, we present an integrated approach through a systematic model-driven evaluation of the production potential for the bacterial production organism Escherichia coli to produce multiple native products from different representative feedstocks through coupling metabolite production to growth rate. Designs were examined for 11 unique central metabolism and amino acid targets from three different substrates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Optimal strain designs were reported for designs which possess maximum yield, substrate-specific productivity, and strength of growth-coupling for up to 10 reaction eliminations (knockouts). In total, growth-coupled designs could be identified for 36 out of the total 54 conditions tested, corresponding to eight out of the 11 targets. There were 17 different substrate/target pairs for which over 80% of the theoretical maximum potential could be achieved. The developed method introduces a new concept of objective function tilting for strain design. This study provides specific metabolic interventions (strain designs) for production strains that can be experimentally implemented, characterizes the potential for E. coli to produce native compounds, and outlines a strain design pipeline that can be utilized to design production strains for additional organisms.},

Such a process is fundamentally iterative, where each iteration involves making model predictions, obtaining experimental data, reconciling the predicted outcomes with experimental ones, and using discrepancies to update the in silico model. Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in Escherichia coli, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks. We find that a systems biology approach that combines genome-scale experimentation and computation can systematically generate hypotheses on the basis of disparate data sources.},

	Abstract = {We describe in this report the characterization of the recently discovered N-linked glycosylation locus of the human bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, the first such system found in a species from the domain Bacteria. We exploited the ability of this locus to function in Escherichia coli to demonstrate through mutational and structural analyses that variant glycan structures can be transferred onto protein indicating the relaxed specificity of the putative oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. Structural data derived from these variant glycans allowed us to infer the role of five individual glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of the N-linked heptasaccharide. Furthermore, we show that C. jejuni- and E. coli-derived pathways can interact in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycoproteins. In particular, the E. coli encoded WecA protein, a UDP-GlcNAc: undecaprenylphosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase involved in glycolipid biosynthesis, provides for an alternative N-linked heptasaccharide biosynthetic pathway bypassing the requirement for the C. jejuni-derived glycosyltransferase PglC. This is the first experimental evidence that biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan occurs on a lipid-linked precursor prior to transfer onto protein. These findings provide a framework for understanding the process of N-linked protein glycosylation in Bacteria and for devising strategies to exploit this system for glycoengineering.},

	Abstract = {In eukaryotes, N-linked protein glycosylation is a universal modification involving addition of preformed oligosaccharides to select Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr motifs and influencing multiple biological events. We recently demonstrated that Campylobacter jejuni is the first member of the Bacteria to possess an N-linked glycan pathway. In this study, high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) was applied to probe and quantitate C. jejuni N-glycan biosynthesis in vivo. To confirm HR-MAS NMR findings, glycosylation mutants were screened for chicken colonization potential, and glycoproteins were examined by mass spectrometry and lectin blotting. Consistent with the mechanism in eukaryotes, the combined data indicate that bacterial glycans are assembled en bloc, emphasizing the evolutionary conservation of protein N glycosylation. We also show that under the conditions examined, PglG plays no role in glycan biosynthesis, PglI is the glucosyltransferase and the putative ABC transporter, and WlaB (renamed PglK) is required for glycan assembly. These studies underpin the mechanism of N-linked protein glycosylation in Bacteria and provide a simple model system for investigating protein glycosylation and for exploitation in glycoengineering.},

In C. jejuni, a heptasaccharide is transferred from an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate donor [GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,4-(Glcbeta1,3)-GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,3-Bac-alpha1-PP-undecaprenyl, where Bac is bacillosamine (2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyglucose)] to the asparagine side chain of target proteins at the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif. In this study, we have cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified PglC, the glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of the undecaprenyl-linked heptasaccharide donor. In addition, we report the first synthetic route to uridine 5'-diphosphobacillosamine. Using the uridine 5'-diphosphobacillosamine and undecaprenyl phosphate, we demonstrate the ability of PglC to produce undecaprenyl pyrophosphate bacillosamine using radiolabeled HPLC and mass spectral analysis. In addition, we revealed that PglC does not accept uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine or uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylgalactosamine as substrates but will accept uridine 5'-diphospho-6-hydroxybacillosamine, an analogue of bacillosamine that retains the C-6 hydroxyl functionality from the biosynthetic precursor. The in vitro characterization of PglC as a bacillosamine 1-phosphoryl transferase provides direct evidence for the early steps in the C. jejuni N-linked glycosylation pathway, and the coupling of PglC with the latter glycosyltransferases (PglA, PglJ, PglH, and PglI) allows for the "one-pot" chemoenzymatic synthesis of the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate heptasaccharide donor.},

We have cloned, overexpressed, and purified PglD from the pgl locus of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 and identified it as the acetyltransferase that modifies the UDP-4-amino-sugar to form UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine, utilizing acetyl-coenzyme A as the acetyl group donor. The UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine product was purified from the reaction by reverse phase C18 HPLC and the structure determined by NMR analysis. Additionally, the full-length PglF was overexpressed and purified in the presence of detergent as a GST fusion protein, allowing for derivation of kinetic parameters. We found that the UDP-4-amino-sugar was readily synthesized from UDP-GlcNAc in a coupled reaction using PglF and PglE. We also demonstrate the in vitro biosynthesis of the complete heptasaccharide lipid-linked donor by coupling the action of eight enzymes (PglF, PglE, PglD, PglC, PglA, PglJ, PglH, and PglI) in the Pgl pathway in a single reaction vessel.},

	Abstract = {Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni have been shown to modify their flagellins with pseudaminic acid (Pse), via O-linkage, while C. jejuni also possesses a general protein glycosylation pathway (Pgl) responsible for the N-linked modification of at least 30 proteins with a heptasaccharide containing 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose, a derivative of bacillosamine. To further define the Pse and bacillosamine biosynthetic pathways, we have undertaken functional characterization of UDP-alpha-D-GlcNAc modifying dehydratase/aminotransferase pairs, in particular the H. pylori and C. jejuni flagellar pairs HP0840/HP0366 and Cj1293/Cj1294, as well as the C. jejuni Pgl pair Cj1120c/Cj1121c using His(6)-tagged purified derivatives. The metabolites produced by these enzymes were identified using NMR spectroscopy at 500 and/or 600 MHz with a cryogenically cooled probe for optimal sensitivity. The metabolites of Cj1293 (PseB) and HP0840 (FlaA1) were found to be labile and could only be characterized by NMR analysis directly in aqueous reaction buffer. The Cj1293 and HP0840 enzymes exhibited C6 dehydratase as well as a newly identified C5 epimerase activity that resulted in the production of both UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-beta-L-arabino-4-hexulose and UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose. In contrast, the Pgl dehydratase Cj1120c (PglF) was found to possess only C6 dehydratase activity generating UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose. Substrate-specificity studies demonstrated that the flagellar aminotransferases HP0366 and Cj1294 utilize only UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-beta-L-arabino-4-hexulose as substrate producing UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-beta-L-AltNAc, a precursor in the Pse biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, the Pgl aminotransferase Cj1121c (PglE) utilizes only UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-xylo-4-hexulose producing UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-GlcNAc (UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose), a precursor used in the production of the Pgl glycan component 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose.},

	Abstract = {The major cell-surface carbohydrates (lipooligosaccharide, capsule, and glycoprotein N-linked heptasaccharide) of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 contain Gal and/or GalNAc residues. GalE is the sole annotated UDP-glucose 4-epimerase in this bacterium. The presence of GalNAc residues in these carbohydrates suggested that GalE might be a UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase. GalE was shown to epimerize UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc in coupled assays with C. jejuni glycosyltransferases and in sugar nucleotide epimerization equilibria studies. Thus, GalE possesses UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase activity and was renamed Gne. The Km(app) values of a purified MalE-Gne fusion protein for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc are 1087 and 1070 microm, whereas those for UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal are 780 and 784 microm. The kcat and kcat/Km(app) values were three to four times higher for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-Gal than for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc. The comparison of the kinetic parameters of MalE-Gne to those of other characterized bacterial UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerases indicated that Gne is a bifunctional UDP-GlcNAc/Glc 4-epimerase. The UDP sugar-binding site of Gne was modeled by using the structure of the UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase WbpP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Small differences were noted, and these may explain the bifunctional character of the C. jejuni Gne. In a gne mutant of C. jejuni, the lipooligosaccharide was shown by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to be truncated by at least five sugars. Furthermore, both the glycoprotein N-linked heptasaccharide and capsule were no longer detectable by high resolution magic angle spinning NMR. These data indicate that Gne is the enzyme providing Gal and GalNAc residues with the synthesis of all three cell-surface carbohydrates in C. jejuni NCTC 11168.},

	Abstract = {Recently, efforts to increase the toolkit which Escherichia coli cells possess for recombinant protein production in industrial applications, has led to steady progress towards making glycosylated therapeutic proteins. Although the desire to make therapeutically relevant complex proteins with elaborate human-type glycans is a major goal, the relatively poor efficiency of the N-glycosylation process of foreign proteins in E. coli remains a hindrance for industry take-up. In this study, a systematic approach was used to increase glycoprotein production titres of an exemplar protein, AcrA, and the resulting glycosylation efficiency was quantified using a combination of Western blots and pseudo Selective Reaction Monitoring (pSRM). Western blot and pSRM results demonstrate that codon optimising the oligosaccharyltransferase, PglB, for E. coli expression, increases efficiency by 77% and 101%, respectively. Furthermore, increasing expression of glycosyltransferase, WecA, in E. coli improves efficiency by 43% and 27%, respectively. However, increasing the amount of donor lipid used in the glycosylation process did not impact on the glycosylation efficiency in this system, with this specific protein.},

	Abstract = {An inverse metabolic engineering strategy was used to select for Escherichia coli cells with an increased capability to N-glycosylate a specific target protein. We developed a screen for E. coli cells containing extra-chromosomal DNA fragments for improved ability to add precise sugar groups onto the AcrA protein using the glycosylation system from Campylobacter jejuni. Four different sized (1, 2, 4, and 8 kb) genomic DNA libraries were screened, and the sequences that conferred a yield advantage were determined. These advantageous genomic fragments were mapped onto the E. coli W3110 chromosome. Five candidate genes (identified across two or more libraries) were subsequently selected for forward engineering verification in E. coli CLM24 cells, utilizing a combination of internal standards for absolute quantitation and pseudo-selective reaction monitoring (pSRM) and Western blotting validation. An increase in glycosylated protein was quantified in cells overexpressing 4-α-glucantransferase and a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system, amounting to a 3.8-fold (engineered cells total = 5.3 mg L(-1) ) and 6.7-fold (engineered cells total = 9.4 mg L(-1) ) improvement compared to control cells, respectively. Furthermore, increased glycosylation efficiency was observed in cells overexpressing enzymes involved with glycosylation precursor synthesis, enzymes 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (1.3-fold) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (1.6-fold). To evaluate the wider implications of the engineering, we tested a modified Fc fragment of an IgG antibody as the target glycoprotein with two of our engineered cells, and achieved a ca. 75% improved glycosylation efficiency.},

Although functionality of the native Campylobacter jejuni N-glycosylation system in E. coli has been demonstrated, the efficiency of the process using the well-characterized C. jejuni glycoprotein AcrA, was found to be low at 13.4$\pm$0.9% of total extracted protein. A combined approach using isobaric labeling of peptides and probability-based network analysis of metabolic changes was applied to forward engineer E. coli to improve glycosylation efficiency of AcrA. Enhancing flux through the glyoxylate cycle was identified as a potential metabolic manipulation to improve modification efficiency and was achieved by increasing the expression of isocitrate lyase.

	Abstract = {The Campylobacter jejuni pgl gene cluster encodes a complete N-linked protein glycosylation pathway that can be functionally transferred into Escherichia coli. In this system, we analyzed the interplay between N-linked glycosylation, membrane translocation and folding of acceptor proteins in bacteria. We developed a recombinant N-glycan acceptor peptide tag that permits N-linked glycosylation of diverse recombinant proteins expressed in the periplasm of glycosylation-competent E. coli cells. With this "glycosylation tag," a clear difference was observed in the glycosylation patterns found on periplasmic proteins depending on their mode of inner membrane translocation (i.e., Sec, signal recognition particle [SRP], or twin-arginine translocation [Tat] export), indicating that the mode of protein export can influence N-glycosylation efficiency. We also established that engineered substrate proteins targeted to environments beyond the periplasm, such as the outer membrane, the membrane vesicles, and the extracellular medium, could serve as substrates for N-linked glycosylation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the C. jejuni N-glycosylation machinery is compatible with distinct secretory mechanisms in E. coli, effectively expanding the N-linked glycome of recombinant E. coli. Moreover, this simple glycosylation tag strategy expands the glycoengineering toolbox and opens the door to bacterial synthesis of a wide array of recombinant glycoprotein conjugates.},

@article{1999-szymanski-guerry-MolMicrob,
	Abstract = {A genetic locus from Campylobacter jejuni 81-176 (O:23, 36) has been characterized that appears to be involved in glycosylation of multiple proteins, including flagellin. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core of Escherichia coli DH5alpha containing some of these genes is modified such that it becomes immunoreactive with O:23 and O:36 antisera and loses reactivity with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Site-specific mutation of one of these genes in the E. coli host causes loss of O:23 and O:36 antibody reactivity and restores reactivity with WGA. However, site-specific mutation of each of the seven genes in 81-176 failed to show any detectable changes in LPS. Multiple proteins from various cellular fractions of each mutant showed altered reactivity by Western blot analyses using O:23 and O:36 antisera. The changes in protein antigenicity could be restored in one of the mutants by the presence of the corresponding wild-type allele in trans on a shuttle vector. Flagellin, which is known to be a glycoprotein, was one of the proteins that showed altered reactivity with O:23 and O:36 antiserum in the mutants. Chemical deglycosylation of protein fractions from the 81-176 wild type suggests that the other proteins with altered antigenicity in the mutants are also glycosylated.},

@article{2010-sola-griebenow-Biodrugs,
	Abstract = {During their development and administration, protein-based drugs routinely display suboptimal therapeutic efficacies due to their poor physicochemical and pharmacological properties. These innate liabilities have driven the development of molecular strategies to improve the therapeutic behavior of protein drugs. Among the currently developed approaches, glycoengineering is one of the most promising, because it has been shown to simultaneously afford improvements in most of the parameters necessary for optimization of in vivo efficacy while allowing for targeting to the desired site of action. These include increased in vitro and in vivo molecular stability (due to reduced oxidation, cross-linking, pH-, chemical-, heating-, and freezing-induced unfolding/denaturation, precipitation, kinetic inactivation, and aggregation), as well as modulated pharmacodynamic responses (due to altered potencies from diminished in vitro enzymatic activities and altered receptor binding affinities) and improved pharmacokinetic profiles (due to altered absorption and distribution behaviors, longer circulation lifetimes, and decreased clearance rates). This article provides an account of the effects that glycosylation has on the therapeutic efficacy of protein drugs and describes the current understanding of the mechanisms by which glycosylation leads to such effects.},

@article{2013-merritt-fisher-delisa-BiotechBioeng,
	Abstract = {There is an urgent need for new tools that enable better understanding of the structure, recognition, metabolism, and biosynthesis of glycans as well as the production of biologically important glycans and glycoconjugates. With the discovery of glycoprotein synthesis in bacteria and functional transfer of glycosylation pathways between species, Escherichia coli cells have become a tractable host for both understanding glycosylation and the underlying glycan code of living cells as well as for expressing glycoprotein therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we review recent efforts to harness natural biological pathways and engineer synthetic designer pathways in bacteria for making complex glycans and conjugating these to lipids and proteins. The result of these efforts has been a veritable transformation of bacteria into living factories for scalable, bottom-up production of complex glycoconjugates by design.},
